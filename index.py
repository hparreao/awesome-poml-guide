# Example: Loading and processing a POML file
# To use this example, you would need to:
# 1. Install the POML SDK: pip install poml
# 2. Replace the placeholder functions with actual LLM API calls

# from poml import parse_poml  # This is a placeholder - actual import may vary

    # 
    # 2. Extract components
    # role = poml.role
    # task = poml.task
    # 
    # 3. Process data sources
    # import json
    # with open('./examples/customer_history.json') as f:
    #     customer_history = json.load(f)
    # 
    # 4. Execute template engine
    # processed_prompt = render_template(poml, {'customer_history': customer_history})
    # 
    # 5. Send to LLM API
    # response = call_llm(processed_prompt)
    # 
    # 6. Return or process response
    # return response
